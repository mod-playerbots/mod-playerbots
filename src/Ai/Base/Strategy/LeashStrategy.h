// Keeps a bot from wandering past AiPlayerbot.LeashDistance from the group
// leader while an independent-movement strategy (new rpg, grind, ...) is also
// active. Those strategies propose their own movement actions at relevance
// 3.0-11.0 (see NewRpgStrategy::getDefaultActions, "the relevance should be
// greater than grind"), well above FollowMasterStrategy's default "follow"
// relevance of 1.0 -- so simply also enabling "follow" never wins and never
// actually leashes anything.
//
// This only proposes "follow" once the bot has already exceeded the leash
// distance (see "leash too far" in TriggerContext.h), at a relevance above
// every independent-movement action, so it has zero effect the rest of the
// time. It does not by itself stop new rpg from choosing a target beyond the
// leash distance again immediately after being recalled -- that half is
// handled separately, everywhere new rpg picks a destination: idle NPCs/GOs
// via PossibleNewRpgTargetsValue::AcceptUnit and
// PossibleNewRpgGameObjectsValue::Calculate (PossibleRpgTargetsValue.cpp),
// and grind/camp/quest destinations via WithinLeashRange
// (NewRpgBaseAction.cpp) -- so new rpg's own candidate search never proposes
// something this strategy would just have to fight.
