// Two rules, meant to replace relying on "leash" + "new rpg" for a bot that
// should just stick close and pick up whatever quest-relevant thing is
// already in reach: if something within AiPlayerbot.QuestGrabDistance
// satisfies an incomplete quest right now, interact with it (GrabQuestItemAction);
// otherwise do nothing here and let plain "follow" (relevance 1.0, already
// on by default) keep the bot near the leader.
//
// Deliberately does not invent a destination the way "new rpg" does (no POI
// guessing, no synthetic averaged positions, no Z-height guessing) -- it only
// ever reacts to an object the bot can already see, at its real position, so
// the whole class of bugs that came from guessing a destination in advance
// doesn't apply here by construction.
//
// Opt-in via "nc +grab" rather than added to every bot's permanent baseline
// (AiFactory.cpp:585, where "follow"/"loot"/"quest" already live) -- this is
// new, unvalidated code; fold it into that baseline later once proven.
